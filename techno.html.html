										<h1>TECHNOLOGIES USED AND WHY?</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="#"><img src="#" alt="" /></span>

									<p>This project was so much challenging has a team and we had a good time in making it so the 4 technologies that have been used is shown below:</p>
										<hr class="major" />
                                                                       <h2>1. (CAD)SOFTWARE PACKAGE:</h2>
<p>â€¢	In starting we used CAD because it allows to create accurte design , such as the body, legs, and joints to make sure the robot parts fits together perfectly, the software already provides a large varaity of  3D visulization of diffrent parts and joints so that it makes the task simple by  taking a  3d visualisation of a servo motors and make the 3d parts for joints.</p>
     <p>CAD is also used in simulation and analysing the robots performence so that it can witstand and move its joints without any difficulty. I actually use blender a lot due to experiance in using it but due to the wide range of options in CAD like lterative designing and simulation i changed my mind .We created a digital model of the robot, which we used it to 3d print with the help of Rapid protoyping.</p>

                                                                       <h2>2. 3D MODELLING SOFTWARE:</h2>
<p>For modeling the project we used blender and CAD during diffrent stages of the project to make a comprehentive design .</p>
									<p>Blender was used to create the robots body and limbs,while CAD was used to design the mehanical aspects (Joints).</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>3. 3D PRINTING HARDWARE AND WORKSHOP FACILITIES:</h2>
									<p>WE actually where  to use the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) method for printing the 3D hardware.It is actually the most commonenly used method .In this method aa thermo plastic filament is put into a heated extruder which melts the plastic after that the melted plastic is extracted into a nozzle , which deposits the plastic in to create a layer after that the plastic is cooled and turns in solid.The main adavantages of FDM is its cost effective and easy to use , it has fast build time and wide material range by comapring with others.The downfall for FDS is it will product a rough surface finish and the amounts of details on the object will be less but we went for SLA because it was done in the university.</p>
									<p>The workshop facilites we basically used is Ardunio nano and (micro controller)and servo motors we used is SG90 the advantage of the motor is it  can rotate  360 degree continuously .</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>4. RESIN PRODUCTION:</h2>
									<p>Also known has sterolithograghy(sla)or resin 3d printing was the method we used to print our parts in this method they use photosensitive resin to create good detailed and precise object.unlike FDM the resin method gives high detailing and smooth surface with low material waste.we used resin method to make the servo motors mounts and the body parts.</p>
